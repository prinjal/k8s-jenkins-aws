# CI/CD Pipeline for Cloud-Native Applications on AWS with Jenkins and EKS

This project comprises the practices of DevOps, cloud-native development, and automation, demonstrating a seamless Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline built atop AWS. Leveraging Jenkins for automation, Docker for containerization, and Amazon EKS for orchestrated deployment, this pipeline epitomizes modern application delivery.

## Project Overview

Architected CI/CD pipeline, designed to facilitate a streamlined path from code commit to deployment in a  Kubernetes environment.

### Key Components

- **AWS EC2**: Hosting Jenkins and integrating seamlessly with other AWS services.
- **Jenkins**: Orchestrates the workflow, from code integration, testing, to deployment, enriched with a wide array of plugins for enhanced functionality.
- **Docker**: Containerizes applications, ensuring consistency across different environments and simplifying deployments.
- **AWS CLI, Kubectl, and eksctl**: Facilitates interaction with AWS services and Kubernetes, enabling infrastructure as code (IaC) practices.
- **Amazon EKS**: Offers a managed Kubernetes service, simplifying cluster management, scaling, and deployment processes.
